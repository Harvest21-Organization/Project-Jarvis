# User Story ID: 1  
As a Supporter, I want to request to follow a Missionary so that I can access their private content once approved.  

Acceptance Criteria:  
- When I visit a missionary’s profile and I am not already following or pending, tapping Follow creates a Follow Request with status "pending".  
- The Follow button changes to "Requested" or "Pending" after I submit the request.  
- If I tap Follow again while the request is pending, nothing happens (no duplicate requests).  
- If I am already an approved follower, the button shows "Following" and is not clickable.  
- I do not gain access to restricted content until my request is approved.  
- The missionary receives an in-app notification stating “[Supporter Name] has requested to follow you”.  

Priority: High  
Dependencies: Notification system, Follow Request data model  
Notes: No auto-approval; each request requires explicit missionary approval.

# User Story ID: 4  
As a Supporter, I want restricted content (photos, videos, prayer wall, chat) from a missionary to be visible only if my follow request is approved so that my access respects the missionary’s privacy controls.  

Acceptance Criteria:  
- Missionary basic profile info is visible to all users (public).  
- Restricted content (photos, videos, prayer wall, chat, supporter-only feed posts) is only visible if the follower’s status is "accepted".  
- Supporters with pending, declined, or revoked status do not see restricted content.  
- The system correctly enforces these visibility rules consistently.  

Priority: High  
Dependencies: Access control integration with content rendering system, Follow Request status checks  
Notes: Binary access control; only accepted followers see restricted content.

# User Story ID: 5  
As a user (Supporter or Missionary), I want to receive in-app notifications about follow request status changes so that I am promptly informed without email or external messaging.  

Acceptance Criteria:  
- When a supporter sends a follow request, the missionary receives a notification: “[Supporter Name] has requested to follow you.” Clicking it opens the pending requests list or specific request.  
- When a missionary accepts a request, the supporter receives: “Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was accepted.” Clicking it opens the missionary’s profile with restricted content visible.  
- When a missionary declines a request, the supporter receives: “Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was declined.” Clicking it opens the missionary’s profile showing Follow button again, no restricted content.  
- Notifications appear only in the in-app notification system (no email, SMS, or push for MVP).  

Priority: High  
Dependencies: Notification system UI, notification triggers on request create/accept/decline events  
Notes: Use existing application notification infrastructure.
