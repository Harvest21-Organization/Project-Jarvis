# User Stories: Missionary Follow / Follower Management

---

**User Story ID:** 1  
**As a** Supporter  
**I want to** request to follow a missionary from their profile  
**so that** I can gain access to their private content once approved.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- When visiting a missionary’s profile, the Follow button is visible if not following.  
- Clicking Follow creates a Follow Request with status = pending.  
- The Follow button changes to "Requested" or "Pending" and is not clickable again while pending.  
- No duplicate follow requests are created if I tap Follow multiple times while pending.  
- If already an approved follower, button shows "Following" and is not clickable (no unfollow in MVP).  
- Supporter receives in-app notification if missionarie later approves or declines request.  
- Supporter cannot see restricted content if follow request is pending or declined.

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Missionary profile page, notification system  
**Notes:** No auto-approval; explicit missionary approval is mandatory.

**User Story ID:** 2  
**As a** Missionary  
**I want to** receive in-app notifications when supporters request to follow me  
**so that** I can be aware of new follow requests pending my approval.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- A notification with text “[Supporter Name] has requested to follow you.” appears in my in-app notifications.  
- Clicking the notification opens my Followers dashboard on the Pending Requests tab or relevant request detail.  
- Notifications are created only for new, unique follow requests.

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Follow request creation, notification system  
**Notes:** Notifications only; no email/SMS.

**User Story ID:** 3  
**As a** Missionary  
**I want to** view all pending follow requests  
**so that** I can decide to accept or decline each supporter’s request.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- I can access a Requests tab under Followers section in my dashboard.  
- Each pending request shows supporter name, profile image/avatar placeholder, and time of request.  
- Each request has Accept and Decline actions.  
- Accepting a request changes its status to accepted, turns the supporter into an active follower, and triggers an acceptance notification to supporter.  
- Declining a request changes its status to declined and triggers a declined notification to supporter.  
- Requests remain pending until I take action.

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Notification system, follow request management  
**Notes:** Declined requests can be re-requested later by the supporter.

**User Story ID:** 4  
**As a** Supporter  
**I want to** be notified if my follow request is accepted or declined

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- If accepted, supporter sees an in-app notification: “Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was accepted.”  
- Clicking notification opens missionary profile with restricted content accessible.  
- If declined, supporter sees an in-app notification: “Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was declined.”  
- Clicking notification opens missionary profile showing Follow button again and no restricted content.

**Notes:** Notifications only; no email/SMS.

**User Story ID:** 5  
**As a** Missionary  
**I want to** view a list of all my current followers  
**so that** I can see who has access to my restricted content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- I can open a Followers tab showing all supporters with accepted status.  
- Each follower's name and profile image/avatar is visible.  
- Each follower entry includes a “Remove follower” or “Revoke access” action.

**User Story ID:** 6  
**As a** Missionary  
**I want to** remove followers from my followers list  
**so that** those supporters immediately lose access to my restricted content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Clicking “Remove follower” changes follower’s status to revoked or removes follower link.  
- Immediately revokes supporter’s access to all restricted content types.  
- Supporter visiting profile sees Follow button again, allowing new request submission.  
- (Optional later) Supporter may receive a notification about removal.

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Follower management, access control, notification system (optional)  
**Notes:** Removal takes effect immediately.

---

**User Story ID:** 7  
**As a** System  
**I want to** restrict access to private missionary content to only approved followers  
**so that** supporter-only content remains confidential and secure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Public content is visible to all users regardless of follow status.  
- Restricted content (photos, videos, prayer wall, chat, private posts) are visible only if supporter’s follow request status = accepted.  
- Supporters with pending, declined, or revoked statuses do not see restricted content.  
- This logic is enforced for all missionaries.

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Follow request status tracking, content access permissions  
**Notes:** Binary access model; no partial access.

---

**User Story ID:** 8  
**As a** Supporter  
**I want to** see appropriate button states on missionary profiles based on my follow status  
**so that** I understand if I can request, am pending, or already following.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- If not following or pending, button shows “Follow” or “Requested” accordingly.  
- If pending, tapping button does not create duplicate requests or cause errors.  
- If follower, button shows “Following” and is not clickable (no unfollow in MVP).  
- If access revoked or follower removed, button reverts to “Follow” allowing new request.

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** UI state management, follower status checks  
**Notes:** UX mirrors typical private profile social media flow.
