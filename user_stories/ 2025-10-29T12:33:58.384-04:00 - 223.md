# User Stories for Missionary Follow / Follower Management

---

**User Story ID:** 1  
**As a** Supporter,  
**I want to** request to follow a missionary from their profile page  
**so that** I can gain access to their private/reserved content if approved.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Supporter can tap/click a "Follow" button on any missionary profile.  
- If supporter currently has no pending or accepted follow status, a new follow request with status = pending is created.  
- The "Follow" button changes to "Requested" or similar to indicate pending status.  
- Supporter cannot create duplicate follow requests while one is pending.  
- If supporter is already an accepted follower, button shows "Following" and is not clickable for another request.  
- No automatic approvals happen on follow request creation.  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Notes:** MVP does not require unfollow option.

**User Story ID:** 2  
**As a** Missionary,  
**I want to** receive in-app notifications when a supporter requests to follow me  
**so that** I am aware of new follow requests promptly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- When a supporter creates a new follow request (status = pending), missionary receives an in-app notification with text: "[Supporter Name] has requested to follow you."  
- Notification action opens the missionary’s pending follow requests list or the specific request detail.  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** User Story 1 (follow request creation)  
**Notes:** Notifications live in the existing notifications bell/inbox UI.

---

**User Story ID:** 3  
**As a** Missionary,  
**I want to** view a list of all pending follow requests in a dedicated UI section  
**so that** I can decide whom to approve or decline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Missionary dashboard or a "Followers" tab with a "Requests" section exists showing all pending requests.  
- Each pending request entry includes supporter’s name, profile image/avatar placeholder, request timestamp.  
- Each request shows two clear actions: Accept and Decline.  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** User Story 2 (notification and request creation)  
**Notes:** UI location flexible as long as functionality exists.

---

**User Story ID:** 4  
**As a** Missionary,  
**I want to** accept or decline supporter follow requests  
**so that** I control who can access my private content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Clicking Accept: request status changes to accepted; supporter gains follower status; supporter receives in-app notification: “Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was accepted.”  
- Clicking Decline: request status changes to declined; supporter does not gain follower status; supporter receives in-app notification: “Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was declined.”  
- If no action taken, request status remains pending and supporter only sees "Requested".  
- Supporters with declined status can submit new follow requests again later (repeat requests allowed without throttling).  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** User Stories 2 and 3  
**Notes:** Repeat requests allowed for MVP.

**User Story ID:** 5  
**As a** Missionary,  
**I want to** view and manage my current followers in a list  
**so that** I can see who has access to my private content and remove followers if needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Missionary can open a "Followers" tab showing all currently accepted followers.  
- Each follower row shows follower's name (optional: profile image).  
- Each follower entry has a “Remove follower” or “Revoke access” action.  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** User Story 4 (accepted followers exist)  
**Notes:** Clear UI for removing followers.

---

**User Story ID:** 6  
**As a** Missionary,  
**I want to** remove/revoke a follower’s access  
**so that** they immediately lose access to my restricted content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Removing a follower sets their follow request status to revoked or equivalent non-accepted state.  
- Removed follower no longer sees restricted content upon next profile visit.  
- Removed follower’s Follow button resets to allow a new follow request.  
- (Optional - for later): Removed follower receives in-app notification about removal (not required for MVP).  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** User Story 5  
**Notes:** Access revocation is immediate.

---

**User Story ID:** 7  
**As a** System,  
**I want to** restrict access to certain missionary content only to approved followers  
**so that** private content remains secure and exclusive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Public missionary profile info (name, country, bio, agency, denomination, support percentage, etc.) is visible to all users regardless of follow status.  
- Restricted content (photo gallery, videos, prayer wall, chat, supporter-only updates) is visible only to supporters with accepted follower status.  
- Supporters with pending, declined, or revoked status do not see restricted content.  
- Binary access control: either follower is accepted and sees restricted content, or does not.  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** User Stories 1, 4, and 6  
**Notes:** Applies to all missionaries.

---

**User Story ID:** 8  
**As a** Supporter,  
**I want to** receive notifications in-app when my follow request is accepted or declined  
**so that** I know the status of my request and can act accordingly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- When missionary accepts a follow request, supporter receives notification: "Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was accepted." Clicking opens the missionary profile with restricted content unlocked.  
- When missionary declines a follow request, supporter receives notification: "Your follow request to [Missionary Name] was declined." Clicking opens the missionary profile with follow button active again but no restricted content visible.  

**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** User Story 4  
**Notes:** All notifications are in-app only, no email/ SMS/ push for MVP.
