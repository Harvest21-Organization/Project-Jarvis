## 📖 Narrative

**Meet Sarah**, a missionary in South Africa with a calling to connect with supporters globally. Despite newsletters and email lists, engagement is low and managing updates is a time sink. With Harvest 21, Sarah creates her landing page in minutes—her banner, updates, prayer requests, and videos all in one place.

Users who follow her now receive instant notifications when she posts an update. Supporters can pray right on her wall, share her link, or even schedule a visit if she’s available. Mission agencies finally have visibility into field interactions and Sarah can focus more on ministry. Harvest 21 is now her digital sending base—a living, breathing space connecting the Great Commission to real faces.
