## Narrative

Maria is a missionary serving overseas who struggles to keep her supporters informed and engaged. Before Harvest 21, she juggled emails, social media, and various fundraising platforms with little integration. With Harvest 21, Maria creates a personalized landing page featuring her family photo, ministry banner, and intuitive tabs for updates, prayer requests, and pictures.

Supporters find Maria easily via searchable mission agency and country filters; they follow her, receive notifications for updates, and donate securely with recurring options. Maria interacts directly through notifications, seeing real-time prayer support and donations, while her mission agency tracks her engagement and giving stats through a centralized dashboard.

The result is a thriving missionary-support ecosystem: Maria feels empowered to communicate her ministry effectively, supporters feel connected and appreciated, and mission agencies streamline oversight and fundraising. Harvest 21 becomes a vital tool, amplifying missionary impact worldwide.
