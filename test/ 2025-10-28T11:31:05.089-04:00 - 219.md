Sarah is a missionary serving in South America. She wants to keep her supporters up-to-date with her ministry, share prayer requests, and securely receive donations. Using the Harvest 21 platform, Sarah quickly sets up her landing page with her family photo and ministry banner. She uploads recent videos, prayer requests, and documents easily. Her supporters create accounts to follow her updates, receive personalized notifications, and donate with just a few clicks securely routed through her mission agency. Sarah’s sending church efficiently monitors her support and engagement via their neighborhood page. When Sarah schedules a live virtual event, her followers get notified automatically, increasing participation.
