## Technical Considerations

- Mobile frontend with Flutter 3, adopting Material 3 and Cupertino design for platform-specific experience.  
- Shared design tokens and components ensure visual parity.

### API & Backend Architecture
- Backend API developed in FastAPI (Python) for async, scalable REST endpoints.  
- Primary data stored in PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) with normalized schemas for users, missionaries, content, donations, notifications, etc.  
- Optional vector database (e.g., Pinecone) for tag-based recommendations and content search.  
- Authentication and User Management via AWS Cognito with multi-factor auth for admins.  
- File storage (images, documents, videos) managed through AWS S3 with CDN (CloudFront) caching.  
- Donation payment processing integrated via external PCI-compliant gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) with routing logic to mission agencies.  
- Hosting backend on AWS ECS with Lambda edge functions for serverless events. Web assets served via AWS Amplify or CloudFront.

### Performance & Scalability
- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and load time.  
- Lazy-loaded media and tabs for faster initial interaction.  
- Horizontal auto-scaling for API and worker nodes.  
- CDN-backed static assets and images to minimize latency globally.

### Security
- Encrypted storage and HTTPS enforced throughout.  
- Role-based access control for admin, missionary, and supporter interactions.  
- Automated content filtering and admin notifications for moderation.  
- Payment data handled entirely by PCI-compliant services; minimized PII retention.  
- Rate limiting and IP blocking to prevent abuse.
